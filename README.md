# Beecrowd C Problems Solutions

This repository contains my **daily solved problems from Beecrowd using C language** to improve my problem-solving and coding skills consistently.

## 🛠 Structure

- All problems are organized in folders like:
    ```
    beginner/
        1010.c
        1011.c
        ...
    intermediate/
        ...
    ```
- File names follow the problem number for easy tracking.

## 🚀 Objective

✅ Improve consistency in problem-solving  
✅ Build a public coding portfolio  
✅ Track learning progress over time  
✅ Help others to learn from clean C solutions

## 📅 Plan

I will upload **6-7 solved problems daily** until I complete all beginner and intermediate problems.

## ⚡ Language

All solutions are implemented in **C language** using clean, readable code.
